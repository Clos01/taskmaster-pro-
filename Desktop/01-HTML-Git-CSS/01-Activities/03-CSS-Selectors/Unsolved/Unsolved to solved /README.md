## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

- What are pseudo-class selectors? A CSS pseudo-class is a term added to a selector that indicates the chosen element's special status (s). When the user's cursor hovers over a button, for example,:hover may be used to alter its color.

/_ Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering _/
button:hover {
color: blue;

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
